Benefits of Dart
----------------------
- Use of async and await for asynchronous programming.
- Dart is one of very few languages(and perhaps the only "mainstream" language) that is well suited to being compiled
  both AOT(ahead-of-time) and JIT(just-in-time). Supporting both kinds of compilation provides significant advantages to Dart and
  (especially) Flutter(Hot Reload Feature).
- JIT compilation is used during development,using a compiler that is wspecially fast.Then,when an app is ready for release,it is compiled AOT.
- Extreamly fast development cycles, and fast execution and startup times.
- Dart can be compiled into JavaScript so it can be executed on browsers.
- Flutter doesn't split layout between your program and an additonal templating or layout language like JSX or XML, nor does it required separate
  visual layout tools.
